# RedBlackTreeSet
*This is the first part of algorithms and data structures project done in the academic year 2020/2021*

We want to create a data structure for generic sets based on Red Black trees. The data structure shall allow for the execution of canonical operations of intersection, union and difference between two sets, each tree represents a set. The set elements (integers) are stored within a text file, elements belonging to the same set are on the same separate line by space.
